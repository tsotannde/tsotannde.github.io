# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
The live site is accessible through my custom domain, which is managed through Squarespace and forwarded to my GitHub Pages deployment.

### 🌐 Live Website
**https://adebayosotannde.com** → forwards to GitHub Pages  
GitHub Pages URL (direct): **https://tsotannde.github.io**

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **Pinegrow Web Editor** — used for visual editing and layout adjustments
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting the website
- **EmailJS** — powers the contact form (no backend required)
- **Google Maps Embed API** — for the location section

### 📬 Contact Form
The contact form uses **EmailJS** to send messages directly to my email without any backend server.  
All styling and behavior is handled client-side.

### 🎯 Purpose
This repository is strictly for my portfolio website.  
It is not intended to showcase my software or iOS development work — only the website design and functionality.

### 📁 Notes

- The site automatically updates as soon as changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
